## Self Reflections
- > This was a wonderful little walkthrough that showed how to manipulate file input and output, read content from a CSV file, transform into standardized format, utilize data to contact a remote service, populate a template with user data, manipulate strings, access Google's Civic Information API through Google API Client gem, and ERB for templating.
